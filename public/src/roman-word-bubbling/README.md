# Roman Word Bubbling

## Background
CVI (cortical/cerebral visual impairment) is the leading cause of blindness in children today. Children with CVI typically have some vision but have difficulty processing complex visual information.

Dr. Christine Roman-Lantzy, one of the foremost leaders in CVI research, developed a system of bubbling words to emphasize the salient features of the word as a way to reduce visual complexity and improve literacy education for students with CVI.

Previously parents and educators were manually drawing these outlines. This is time-intensive and imprecise. Experts express concern that it can be done incorrectly, thus decreasing the effectiveness.

## Approach
This application automates the process of bubbling words to facilitate literacy education for the visually impaired. It is intended to be used by parents and educators as a tool to assist them in the teaching process.

## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Dr. Roman-Lantzy for her guidance and support and to all the other parents and educators who inspired and tested this project.
